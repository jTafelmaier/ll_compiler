Implement, in order:
- importing other files
- built in ll file?
- type inference for literals
- type inference for expressions using built in functions
- type inference for user-defined functions
- type inference for expressions using user-defined functions
- some way to specify that multiple arguments must have the same type
- lazy execution
- floats, lists, tuples, sets etc.
- VScode: implement language server for ll
- VScode: perhaps show argument names when multiple arguments passed
- perhaps: enums (for class attribute access?)
- perhaps: namespaces (maybe modules suffice)
- perhaps: prohibit clashing variable names
- perhaps: utilities for function signatures
- pure - modifying function differentiation
- (automatic parallelization)


Refactor, in order:
- json structure
