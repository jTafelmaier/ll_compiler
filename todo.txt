- comments
- type inference
- map and retainIf should return iterators (lazy execution)
- floats, tuples, sets etc.
- data classes
- enums
- some way to specify that multiple arguments must have the same type
- VScode: implement language server for ll
- VScode: show argument names when multiple arguments passed
- pre-return in function defs
- function groups / namespaces
- builtin ll file
- module imports
- pure - modifying function differentiation
- perhaps prohibit clashing variable names
- (automatic parallelization)
