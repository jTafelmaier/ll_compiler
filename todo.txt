Implement, in order:
- line numbers
- built in ll file?
- type inference for literals
- type inference for expressions using built in functions
- type inference for user-defined functions
- type inference for expressions using user-defined functions
- map and retainIf should return iterators (lazy execution)
- floats, tuples, sets etc.
- data classes
- enums
- some way to specify that multiple arguments must have the same type
- VScode: implement language server for ll
- VScode: show argument names when multiple arguments passed
- pre-return in function defs
- function groups / namespaces
- module imports
- pure - modifying function differentiation
- perhaps prohibit clashing variable names
- (automatic parallelization)


Refactor, in order:
- json structure
